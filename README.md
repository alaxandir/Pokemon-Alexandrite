5.1.3
Game now uses static battle sprites instead of animated ones, this decision came about because it offers greater freedom in mega-evolution sprites and also allows me to add more regional variants. The constraints of using animated sprites prevented me from using a lot of pokemon or forms that I wanted to. This is the best compromise, battle system has been adjusted to compensate, no more panning/swinging camera. I will continue to improve this are me move forward with better battlebacks/etc.
Added sprites for new custom mega-evolutions: Spiritomb, Bastiodon, Dusknoir, Electivire, Empoleon, Magmortar, Magnezone, Mamoswine, Probopass, Rampardos, Rhyperior, Roserade, Weavile, Yanmega
Added sprites for regional variant pokemon and their evolutions: 
Alolan: Meowth, Sandshrew, Diglett, Grimer, Exeggutor, Rattata, Geodude, Marowak, Raichu.
New battle-back graphics added, credits alphabetized, cause it looks nice.
Added 5 new trainers to ice routes.
